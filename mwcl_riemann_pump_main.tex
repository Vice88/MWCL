\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} immense demand on high data rates leads researchers to investigate new technologies to improve conventional concepts.
One concept which improves this performance is the Riemann Pump \cite{VeyracRivetDevalEtAl2014}.
The Riemann Pump is able to generate arbitrary signal waveforms to synthesize e.g. any modulated rf signal.
The possibility to generate any modulated RF signal leads to a much higher data rate as with conventional concepts of RF-FE.
With the co-integration of the digital-to-analog converter with a power amplifier in GaN technology, further external RF front end components are not necessary.
The process is done within one step than to process several explicit components and connect them.
The technology of high electron mobility transistors makes it possible to synthesize output signal for the baseband up to at least 5 GHz.
Synthesizing arbitrary signals with a bandwidth of 5 GHz enables to cover the common mobile communication standards.
Due to the fact that the sum of several signals of the common mobile communication standard can be generated, a concurrent transmitter is built which increases the data rate up to 10 Gbps.
This is the idea of software defined radio, where it is to bring the digital domain as close as possible to the analog.
For this idea a suitable DAC is necessary, which is presented later.

%
%
\section{Concept of the Riemann Pump circuit}
\label{sec:theory}
%
In this section a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is described which is established from the concept of a charge pump.
The digital-to-analog conversion is based on the current steering topology and pumps charges into a capacitive output load.
As the current over time is integrated to form the resulting voltage this custom charge pump is named after the inventor of the Riemann integral, Bernhard Riemann.
%In dependence on Bernhard Riemann, who founded the Riemann integral, this custom charge pump is named Riemann Pump.
%
%\subsection{Idea of the Riemann Pump}
This technique made it possible to synthesize arbitrary signal waveforms by varying the current, see Equation \ref{eq:current_nomenclature_and_classb}.
%, since the output voltage is generated by the integration of different current amplitudes over time at a capacitor, see Equation \ref{eq:current_nomenclature_and_classb}.
%
\begin{align}
  V_{out} =  \frac{1}{C_{out}} \int_0^t \! i_{out}(\tau) \, \mathrm{d}\tau.
    \label{eq:current_nomenclature_and_classb}
\end{align}
%
Absolutely essential to convert digital input data into a defined analog output signal is to establish a defined set of current amplitudes which charge and discharge the output capacitance.
%generate different output signals is to establish different current amplitudes to charge and discharge the output capacitor.
%To generate different output signals it is necessary to establish different constant current amplitudes to charge and discharge the capacitor.
For a high signal integrity of the synthesized signal, a high sampling frequency as well as consistent current sources were needed.
%Consistent current sources as well as a high sampling frequency were needed to ensure a high signal integrity.
In Fig. \ref{fig:SlopeSynthSignal}(a) eight different slopes represent the change of the output voltage for a given sampling interval.
% four different current amplitudes plus their direction times the sampling interval.
These eight slopes correspond to a three bit resolution of the DAC. 
%To explain the concept in a proper way, eight different currents are established which corresponds to a three bit digital-to-analog converter.
Figure \ref{fig:SlopeSynthSignal}(b) illustrates an example of a synthesized output signal using these slopes.

  	\caption{(a) Representation of relative slopes and (b) signal generation with riemann code.}
  	\label{fig:SlopeSynthSignal}
	\end{scriptsize}
\end{figure}
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%To increase the signal integrity it was also possible to increase the sampling frequency and hence decrease sampling time to synthesize the desired signal.
The solid black line represents a former calculated desired output signal which should be synthesized using the Riemann Pump.
For each sampling point the slope is chosen which minimizes the error between the sampled desired and the synthesized signal.
As the eight slopes are encoded it is possible to control the output signal with a digital input stream representing the sequence of slopes to synthesize the signal.

%
%\subsection{Circuit design}
In order to generate these eight different currents the concept of a charge pump in a push-pull configuration is used.
The pushing transistors contribute to an increase of the output signal while the pulling transistors decrease the amplitude of the output signal.
Mandatory for the correct functioning of the push-pull configuration is a digital driver circuit to ensure a proper switching of the transistors connected to the top rail.
% so the pushing transistors switch correctly on/off because they do not have a source grounding.
%To ensure the correct switching of the voltage controlled current source to the top rail a proper driver circuit is needed. 
Figure \ref{fig:schematic_multibit_rp} shows the schematic of the Riemann Pump, where the single stages are cascaded in parallel.
%
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{figure}[htb]

  	\caption{Schematic of the riemann pump. Marked on the left side is the driver circuit which is necessary. The push-pull stages are/were connected in parallel.}
  	\label{fig:schematic_multibit_rp}
	\end{scriptsize}
\end{figure}
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dimension of the power transistors in parallel is increased linearly with the power of 2 to ensure the correct encryption.
The digital driver circuit is marked with the dashed line and is necessary for each single stage cascaded in parallel.
% each higher power transistor is double the size of the former one...
An implemented power amplifier, serving as the output load, makes the use of a RFFE unnecessary.
This technology is capable to provide high power at high switching frequencies, which is intended to get a high sampling rate and hence a high signal integrity.
%A huge advantage of this technology is, that it is able to provide high power while having an immense switching speed and hence synthesize a signal with high integrity.
%In fact of this the load of a the push-pull stage can be implemented as a power amplifier which is directly connected to the antenna for wave propagation.
%Therefore much external components are not necessary.
%Since the input impedance characteristic of a power transistor is capacitive this is utilized to generate the output signal.
%The load of the described concept consists of the input impedance of a power amplifier which amplifies the signal and propagate it to the antenna.
%The charging and discharging of the capacitive input impedance of the power amplifier led to the possibility to generate arbitrary waveforms.

%\section{Output signal simulation of the Riemann Pump}
%\label{sec:simulation}
%% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
%This section describes the simulation results of the presented concept.
%The circuit used for this simulation is based on the assembled device under test, to ensure proper comparison of the results.
%The simulation confirms the possibility to generate different signals using this concept.
%Figure \ref{fig:input_ctrl_signal} shows the input signal (digital) used to control the DAC.


% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Implementation and assembly of a demonstrator}
\label{sec:assembly}
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To the best of the author's knowledge, the first ever built demonstrator in GaN technology is presented.
To keep the measurement complexity small, the built DAC got two bit resolution which is fine to proof the concept.
%In order of limited measurement equipment the demonstrator is built with four inputs which corresponds to a two bit resolution.
%The first ever built demonstrator to proof the concept of the Riemann Pump is presented in the following subsection.
For the digital switching of the GaN power transistors a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) is used which has already implemented a proper driver circuit for the power transistors.
The MMICs are designed and fabricated in the \SI{0.25}{\micro\meter} AlGaN/GaN HEMT technology by Fraunhofer IAF and are of assistance in this realisation of a Riemann Pump, while the conventional application is in a Class-S amplifier \cite{MaroldtDriverConcept}.
Figure \ref{fig:assembled_demonstrator} (a) illustrates the schematic where the grey painted areas represent a single MMIC.
In Fig. \ref{fig:assembled_demonstrator}(b) the layout of the realised demonstrator is shown.
%
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  	\label{fig:assembled_demonstrator}
	\end{scriptsize}
\end{figure}
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
The green shapes represent MIM capacitors for filtering purpose and the black ones the used MMICs.
In order to reduce the impact of phase delays of the signal the input and output lines are of the same length, as well as the bond wires.
%A critical point/ disadvantage of the used MMICs is that their source potential is led to the backside metallisation to ensure proper heat transfer, while the source potential is on ground.
%The problem in this approach is to drive the power transistor to the upper power rail while the source potential is on the output potential of the ic.
The power transistors source potential of the used MMICs got a via to the backside metallisation of the MMIC, hence it was necessary to isolate this contact for the high side (pushing) transistors.
%were processed with backside metallisation and hence the power transistors source potential is grounded, it was necessary to isolate two of the chips.
This isolation is realized by an isolated pad on the substrate.
%To ensure that the pushing transistors source potential is connected to the output line of the DAC they were bonded onto an isolated pad to the substrate.
The trade-off which comes with this solution is the reduced heat transfer.\\
%In fact of this the heat transfer is not optimal since the transistors generate several watts.
%Also two different layouts are designed to compare the property of heat transfer.
% Each MMIC used in this work consists of the elements shown in Fig \ref{fig:schematic_multibit_rp} for the low side, which include the driver circuit of two transistors and the resistor plus the output power transistor.
%In fact of the assembly, one version used a isolated pad in fact of the undesired backside metallisation of the chip.
%This is undesired since the output of the high side stage is the source pin.
%For the low side the source pin is grounded and the output is the drain of the power amplifier.
Nevertheless the first Riemann Pump in GaN technology were assembled and tested.
Figure \ref{fig:photo_chipconnection_demonstrator}(a) shows a photograph of the bonded chip connection according to the layout in Fig. \ref{fig:assembled_demonstrator}(b).
This chip connection marked with the red shape is illustrated in the photograph of Fig. \ref{fig:photo_chipconnection_demonstrator}(b).

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The demonstrator is of the size 50x60 mm, has four input and one output line and in addition to the DC supply voltage connectors a decoupling network.

\section{Time domain measurement of synthesized output signal compared to simulation}
\label{sec:experiment}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%The theoretical waveforms are experimentally verified using the demonstrator which is assembled with four MMICs as shown in Figure \ref{fig:assembled_demonstrator} (b). 
% and consists of an input driver stage with a power transistor.
To proof that the built demonstrator can convert digital input streams into an analog output signal the time domain measurement was performed.
A custom control and measurement strategy was applied to get decent results.
Two differential input signals, hence four signals in total, were applied by an arbitrary waveform generator (Keysight M8195A) to represent the digital data stream. 
These signals had to be amplified by a broadband pre-amplifier and shifted in the DC offset with bias tees to ensure proper switching of the transistors at the input.
%
%\subsection{Time domain measurement with resistive load}
First of all a short stability check was performed to ensure that the DUT does not oscillate.
Further the switches are controlled with an synchronous signal, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:meas_Input_Output_RLoad_100M_SmallSize_Paper}(a), leading to a push-pull measurement with resistive load.
Hence the output signal switches between Vdd and GND as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:meas_Input_Output_RLoad_100M_SmallSize_Paper}(b).
%

\begin{figure}[htb]

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
Figure \ref{fig:meas_Input_Output_RLoad_100M_SmallSize_Paper}(a) illustrates one differential digital input stream generated by the AWG for a data rate of 200 Mbps in the time domain.
Controlling the device under test, loaded with a resistor, with this signal led to the output signal in Figure \ref{fig:meas_Input_Output_RLoad_100M_SmallSize_Paper}(b).
The black dashed line represents the theoretical output of an ideal switch while the grey continuous line shows the measured output signalof the DUT.
%In Figure \ref{fig:meas_Input_Output_RLoad_100M_SmallSize_Paper}(b) the output voltage of the DUT with a resistive load is shown.
%Figure \ref{fig:meas_Input_Output_RLoad_100M_SmallSize_Paper} (a) shows the differential input control signal with an amplitude (peak-to-peak voltage) of 0.7V and a frequency of 100MHz in the time domain.
%\subsection{Time domain measurement with capacitive load}
To show the feasibility to synthesize different output signals the resistive load is replaced by a capacitive load.
%After the successful measurement of the push-pull stage, the feasibility of generating different slopes are measured.
Synchronous on-switching of both pushing transistors while the pulling transistors were closed led to the expected results as already shown with the resistive load.
Here the capacitor is charged with the maximum available current, hence the biggest slope is chosen.
In order to select a smaller slope both pushing as well as both pulling transistors had to be switched asynchronous.
The smaller slope $1 i_0$ is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:meas_Output_CLoad_100M_1io_3io}(a) while the bigger slope $3 i_0$ is shown in (b).
